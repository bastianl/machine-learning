Accuracy, Precision, and Recall (and F1 Score, a weighted average of Precision and Recall) are very useful for classification problems.

Therefore it is more useful to measure an aggregation of errors for all our predictions. Mean squared error accomplishes this as follows:\n",

    "**Answer: ** Cross-validation is when a holdout set is used to evaluate the model on a set of data it has not seen before. This is useful in grid-search, as we can make sure our model isn't overfitting as we use the validation set to score each model, but we still have a test-set to evaluate the best model at the end of our workflow. Cross validation also has the benefit of not requiring any additional data, as parts of our training set are \"held out\" in each iteration of KFold cross validation, for instance, which are then averaged or smoothed later for better results."

    "In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing error rates on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `max_depth` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects learning and testing errors. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone."

This is likely because we are making predictions based off a small amount of data, which does not represent our population well. The testing error seems to continue approaching a lower bound (on average, it oscilates), possibly around 5 (`$5000`). However, we can see the model still has a fair amount of variance, as the distance between the testing and training error is around 2 (`$2000`)."

This could indicate our model complexity is too low. When max_depth = 10, we see that our training error is much lower then our testing error, indicating that the model is overfitting our data. This is an example of high variance."

Furthermore, as maximum depth increases the magnitutde of (test_error - train_error) not only increases, but our test error also seems to increase, further indicating overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like the model which best generalizes the dataset is max_depth=6. We see a sort of valley: the test error is lower then at other max_depths, but the variance is not yet very high. Considering the principle of Occams razor, we would select this model as it has lowest complexity, despite the similar test error of other models with higher complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another indicator of overfitting is that the graph exists in two phases. During the first phase, up to around max_depth = 5-6 the test_error and training_error both decrease. After max_depth = 6, the training error continues to decrease (overfitting), while the test_error oscilates and slightly increases on average."

When applying grid search along with cross-validation to optimize your model, it would typically be performed and validated on a training set and subsequently evaluated on a **dedicated test set**. In this project, the optimization below is performed on the *entire dataset* (as opposed to the training set you made above) due to the many outliers in the data. Using the entire dataset for training provides for a less volatile prediction at the expense of not testing your model's performance. \n",

    "It looks like RM, CRIM, and PTRATIO where all considered in our final decision tree model. However, NOX, LSTAT, and DIS were also considered as very important features in our model criteria. I would expect to see some correlation between LSTAT and CRIM, as typically crime rates are higher in lower income populations <sup>1</sup>. However, it is also clear that population income could be correlated with housing prices, regardless of crime rate. Finally, NOX (nitric oxides concentration) and DIS (distance from city centers, which would impact commute time) clearly affect quality of life, so it is expected that these are important factors in our model.\n",
